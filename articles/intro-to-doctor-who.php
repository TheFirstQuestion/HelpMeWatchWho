<h2>What is <i>Doctor Who</i> About?</h2>

<div class="imgWrapper fullSize"><img src="images/about.png" /></div>

<p><i>Doctor Who</i> is not a normal television show. It has two stories&#8212;each episode has its own plot and resolution and lessons learned and all those typical things. But there's also a deeper meaning, lessons and morals that apply to real life. <i>Doctor Who</i> isn't typical sci-fi in that it isn't full of violence and complicated tech-talk&#8212;the story revolves around the characters.</p>

<div class="imgWrapper"><img src="images/romance.jpg" /><img src="images/fairy tale.jpg" /></div>

<p>Basically, <i>Doctor Who</i> is about a man called "the Doctor." <span class="small"><i>(Doctor Who?</i> you might ask. Exactly).</span> The Doctor is an alien from the planet Gallifrey. He ran away a long time ago, stealing a spaceship called "the TARDIS" from a repair shop and building a tool called the "sonic screwdriver." He travels through time and space, landing wherever and whenever he wants. Often, he picks "companions" up and travels with them for a while.</p>

<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Sometimes, the Doctor is referred to as "Doctor Who" or "Dr. Who." This is the way he was named in the credits when the show first began; in modern times, however, he is properly called only "the Doctor." This can be confusing for new viewers. <b>Warning:</b> Many members of the fandom will get really annoyed or angry if you call him "Dr. Who."</p>

<p>Rarely does the Doctor actually know what's going on. He frequently lands in a place he hadn't intended, or stumbles upon crises he didn't know about. But no matter where the Doctor goes, trouble always finds him. He and his companions will find a problem and fix it, saving everyone in the process.</p>

<p>Usually he responds to chaos with pleasure: the Doctor thrives on craziness and adventure. He and his companions genuinely enjoy running from aliens and trying to save lives. Many episodes are funny and lighthearted and nice.</p>

<p>But sometimes episodes are sad, or tragic. The Doctor has lived for a long time. He can't win every time. He's been hurt so many times and lost so much that it seems sometimes like he won't continue.</p>

<p>But he always goes on. He lives his life, constantly moving and adventuring and finding joy in the most basic of things.
