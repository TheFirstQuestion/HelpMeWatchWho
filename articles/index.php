		<p>
		Officially, <em>Doctor Who</em> is a British science-fiction television show about an alien called "the Doctor." He travels through space and time in a spaceship disguised as a police box, fighting aliens and saving the universe with the help of his compmanions. 
		<br><br>
		But it's so much more than that. 
		<br><br>
		<em>Doctor Who</em> is a show about bravery and cowardice, love and loss, skill and intellect, and what it means to be human. It's a show about finding the ordinary in the extraordinary, embracing your inner darkness, and doing the right thing, even when everyone else just runs away. It's about knowing that you have the choice, at any time, to be the most important person in the universe or the least significant thing in the world. <em>Doctor Who</em> is a show about finding a better way to live your life.
