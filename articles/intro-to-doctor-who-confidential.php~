<p>When <em>Doctor Who</em> returned in 2005, the BBC created a companion program called <em>Doctor Who Confidential</em>. After each new episode of the main show aired, viewers were treated to a 30-40 minute documentary behind the scenes of that episode. Each episode of <em>Confidential</em> included interviews with cast and crew, footage from behind the scenes, and discussions about the episode.</p>

<p><em>Confidential</em> continued to accompany <em>Doctor Who</em> through seasons 1-6, when it was definitively cancelled. Episodes were released on DVD in "cut-down" form; they were 10-15 minutes long and had licensed music and discussion of Classic Who removed.</p>

<p>Due to popular demand, the BBC created a new behind-the-scenes show for season 8 called <em>Doctor Who Extra</em>. For season 8, each episode was about 10 minutes long and included interviews and exclusive footage from the <em>Doctor Who</em> episode, just like <em>Confidential</em>. For season 9, the format changed to several shorter 1-2 minute clips per episode.</p>

<p>Watching <em>Confidential</em>, even if you've already seen all of <em>Doctor Who</em>, can be very worthwhile. The purpose of the show is to take an in-depth look at the episode and provide more information about it: how special effects were created, characterization, how actors were cast, connections to <em>Doctor Who</em> history, and many other pieces of information.</p>

<p><em>Confidential</em> and <em>Extra</em> episodes are as follows (<em>Doctor Who</em> episode in parentheses):</p>
	
	<ul>

<?php

	require("../helper.php");

	$episodes = db_select("SELECT * FROM `BehindTheScenes` WHERE `Title` LIKE '%Confidential%' OR `Title` LIKE '%Extra%' ORDER BY `Title`");
	
	foreach ($episodes as $i) {
		$epID = $i[LinkID];
		$ep = db_select("SELECT * FROM `Episodes` WHERE `EpisodeID` = $epID");
		echo "<li><a href='" . $i[Link] . "'>" . $i[Title] . "</a> (" . $ep[0][Season] . " " . $ep[0][Title] . ")</li>";
	}
