<h2>What is a Spin-Off?</h2>

<p>Wikipedia defines a spin-off to be "derived from one or more already existing works, that focuses, in particular, in more detail on one aspect of that original work (e.g. a particular topic, character, or an event)." In layman's terms, this means that a spin-off is a show about something from a popular show, usually a character. The show exist in the same universe, meaning that events (such as an invasion of aliens) or facts (such as the existance of superpowers) are the same in both shows.</p>

<p>For example, a <em>Harry Potter</em> spin-off might have James Potter, Harry's father, as the main character. The story would explain things referenced in the books, and the same rules about magic would apply, but it's not about Harry himself. The two stories would be connected and take place in the same universe, but it's not necessarily a sequel or a prequel. Because the two stories exist in the same universe, however, their relative timeline of events must be consistent. For books, that's not too hard, but for TV shows, that's a little more complicated. Especially for <em>Doctor Who</em>, because it involves time travel, you can end up with diagrams like these:</p>

<p><em>Doctor Who</em> has three main spin-offs: <a href="#class"><em>Class</em></a>, <a href="#torchwood"><em>Torchwood</em></a>, and <a href="#sja"><em>The Sarah Jane Adventures</em></a>. It also had a few minor spin-offs, including <a href="#k9co"><em>K-9 and Company</em></a>, <a href="#k9"><em>K-9</em></a>, and <a href="#probe"><em>P.R.O.B.E</em></a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction to <em>Class</em></h2>

<div class="fullSize"><img src="images/class.jpg" /></div>

<p><strong>What It's About: </strong><em>"The sixth formers of Coal Hill Academy all have their own secrets and desires. They have to deal with the stresses of everyday life, including friends, parents, school work, sex, and sorrow, but also the horrors that come from time travel. The Doctor and his time-travelling have made the walls of space and time stretch thin, and monsters beyond imagination are planning to break through and wreak havoc upon the Earth."</em> <em>Class</em> revolves around an alien prince, Charlie, a refugee hiding on Earth after the destruction of his own people. His protector and former enemy, Miss Quill, pretends to be a teacher at Coal Hill, where Charlie attends. When the hostile aliens who killed their people begin to attack Coal Hill, Miss Quill and Charlie, along with his friends April, Tanya, and Ram, are tasked with protecting the Earth.</p>

<br><br>

<p><strong>Why You Should Watch It: </strong><em>Class</em> is a good show, even seen by itself. It's connections with <em>Doctor Who</em> are, like all of its spin-offs, tenuous and subtle, except for the occasional visit from the Doctor. It's not necessarily going to add any information to the main show, but it's a good watch and an enjoyable show.</p>
